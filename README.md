Here are my old, crappy projects from school. 

I have included some files from past work for companies, 

All of these source files are licensed as open source, except for the html, which, of course, is just downloaded from whatever site hosted it, publicly, on the net. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about it. 

If you want help with any of Fred George's programming classes, and I mean any, hit me up. I know things.
